Yahtzee

The goal is to get the highest total score in 13 turns.
Each turn begins with rolling the dice. You can reroll any/all of the dice for a total of 3 rolls per turn.
After you have finished rolling, you must score one of the 13 categories on the scoresheet with either a zero or a score value.
Once a category has been scored (zero or otherwise) it cannot be scored again.
Scoring is dependent on the combination of the final dice values.
The scoring is as follows:

Aces - Sum of Aces
Twos - Sum of Twos
Threes - Sum of Threes
Fours - Sum of Fours
Fives - Sum of Fives
Sixes - Sum of Sixes
3 of a Kind - Sum of all dice
4 of a Kind - Sum of all dice
Full House (3 of a kind + 2 of a kind) - 25 points
Sm. Straight (4 dice in sequence) - 30 points
Lg. Straight (5 dice in sequence) - 40 points
Chance (no requirements) - Sum of all dice
YAHTZEE (5 of a Kind) - 50 points

If YAHTZEE has already been scored 50 points, then all subsequent yahtzees gain a 100 point bonus and another category must be scored using the Joker Rules.
If YAHTZEE has been scored zero, then all subsequent yahtzees score no bonus and a category must be scored using the Joker Rules.

Joker Rules:
Score the appropriate Upper Section category with the sum of the dice. (Ex. a yahtzee of 5's would score 25 in 'Fives').
If the Upper Section category has been scored, then score any Lower Section category with the standard scoring calculations.
If both the appropriate Upper Section and all Lower Section categories have been scored, then choose an available Upper Section category to score zero in.

Upper Section Bonus:
If the Upper section total is 63 or greater, then a bonus of 35 points is added to the Grand Total.

The game ends once all 13 categories have been scored.

Good Luck!
